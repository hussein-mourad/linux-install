  "description": "Give a function to any corner or edge of your monitors and expand your keyboard's capabilities. Mouse pointer pressure, clicks and scrolls over the corners/edges or keyboard shortcuts can trigger any of dozens of built-in actions or your own shell commands.\nThis extension is a big collection of actions that lets you navigate and control the Gnome Shell environment and windows and launch applications and scripts not only through the corners and edges of your monitors, but also using the custom keyboard shortcuts.\n\nRestart your Gnome Shell after each update of the extension to load new code, and reload this site to get rid of the error message, before you post a bug report.\nPlease report bugs/issues on GitHub linked below and add output from these two commands:\njournalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell --since \"2 days ago\" | grep corners-extended\njournalctl /usr/bin/gjs --since \"2 days ago\" | grep corners-extended\n\nkeywords: overview, app grid, command, brightness, contrast, transparent, opacity, color effect, invert lightness, color tint, color blind simulation, desaturate, night lights, dark theme, volume, mute, magnifier, zoom, screen keyboard, reader, large text, force close, kill -9, show desktop, reorder workspace, window thumbnail / preview, looking glass, custom menu, window, workspace, switcher, hide panel",
